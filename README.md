## 📌 Project Summary

FinSage AI is a personal finance desktop app that integrates:

1. **Smart Ledger with Voice Input**

   * 🎙️ Add transactions using voice commands
   * 📋 Tracks income, expenses, categories, and dates with real-time UI updates

2. **Automated Reports + Filters**

   * 🧾 Generate PDF reports with filters (date, city, province, party)
   * 📊 View summaries of balances and transactions by category or location

3. **AI-Driven Insights (Upcoming)**

   * 📈 Forecast savings, expenses, and budgets using LSTM models
   * 🤖 Integrated chatbot for financial planning tips

---

## 🧠 How it Works

### 🎙️ Voice Ledger Entry

* Voice commands (via `SpeechRecognition`) converted into text
* Parses entries like: `"Add expense 1200 groceries"`
* Stores data in structured format in SQLite or Supabase

### 🧾 Report Generation

* Select filters (city, date range, party name, province)
* Auto-generates styled PDF using FPDF / ReportLab
* Reports include transaction breakdowns and balance charts

### 📊 Financial Overview & Goals

* Track goals like “Save 10k/month” or “Limit food to 5k”
* Visual dashboards for category-wise spending
* Daily, weekly, monthly summaries using matplotlib
